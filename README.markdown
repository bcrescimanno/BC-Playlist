# Brightcove Sample Playlist

A simple [jQueryUI]("http://jqueryui.com") widget for generating a playlist of videos hosted by [Brightcove]("http://brightcove.com").

*Brightcove does not endorse or support this example in any way*

## Usage

Within playlist.html, add your API key and playlist ID and then load the page in a browser. 

## Additional Info

It's a very simple playlist; more as a demo of how we can work with the [Brightcove-API module]("http://github.com/bcrescimanno/Brightcove-API") and shape the data into a usable form with jQueryUI.

I don't intend to continue this project further and it is in no way "production ready" code. I encourage you to fork the project and play with it to learn more about [jQueryUI]("http://jqueryui.com") and the Brightcove API.
